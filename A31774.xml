            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:30035:3"/>means they might beſt be provided for, with the leaſt trouble or diſcommodation to the Country.</p>
            <p>They met this day at <hi>Chriſt Church</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords, and others the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners; and after ſome debate with the Lords, and afterwards amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the neceſsity of the ſervice being conſidered, and the Kings reſolution being declared unto them, that His Majeſty would juſtly ſatisfy and pay unto them, what the weekly charge ſhould amount unto, according to thoſe proportions which had formerly been propounded.</p>
            <p>They returned this anſwer unto the Kings Commiſsioners; That as many as were then preſent did for their own parts, and ſo much as concerned themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and did believe that thoſe who were abſent, would agree likewiſe, that they would at the generall charge of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty provide for ſuch a number of Horſe and Horſe-men, as were expreſſed in the Votes delivered unto them, at ſuch rates as ſhould with equality be agreed upon.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:30035:3"/>
            <p>But by way of caution for the Kings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and thrift, as well as for the ſaving of their own proviſions, they did move, that there might be care taken, that the numbers might be completed in every Troop, and that neither they might be forced to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for, nor the King to pay for, a greater number then in truth were there from time to time in the Kings ſervice. That being admitted,</p>
            <p>It was moved on the behalfe of the Country, to the end that this charge upon the whole County might be equally laid, that the ſame courſe might be held in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying of theſe monies, as hath been uſually held in the leavying of other publique charges; and that to that purpoſe the Cleark of the Peace and ſuch others as were beſt experienced therein, ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Lord chief-Juſtice, and ſome other Gentlemen of the Country, to diſpoſe of the leavy in ſuch equall portions; which was agreed unto on all parts.
<note place="margin">7<hi rend="sup">s</hi> by the week for a Horſe. 3<hi rend="sup">s</hi> 6 for a Man.</note> And it was alſo propounded and agreed unto, that the prices of Hay, Straw, Oates, and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30035:4"/>and proviſions for the purpoſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, ſhould be indifferently ſet and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon, which being done, the Lords and others the Kings Commiſsioners did undertake to move the Kings Majeſty, that He would be pleaſed upon a true account to repay theſe Monies, whatſoever they ſhould amount unto, as ſoon as monies ſhould come unto Him, either by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of other Counties, or otherwiſe; and in the mean time to ſecure the ſame unto the Country, in ſuch a way, and by ſuch reall and good ſecurity, as they ſhould hold themſelves well ſatisfied with; and when the repaiment ſhall come, it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that it ſhould be in the ſame propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to every ſeverall Pariſh, and diviſions in the County as it is disburſed; and to that purpoſe it is agreed, that ſuch perſons ſhall be truſted on the behalfe of the Country to receive the Kings ſecurity, and ſuch to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute the Mony upon the repayment, as any three of the Gentlemen now preſent being deputed by the reſt ſhall think fit.</p>
            <p>It is further agreed, that the Monies thus
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30035:4"/>to be collected, ſhall be firſt collected by the Petty-Conſtables of every Pariſh for the Inhabitants, and by them be paid over to the High-Conſtables, and by them paid to ſuch hands for the purpoſes aforeſaid, as the King ſhall under His hand appoint. And it is farther agreed, that the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this County ſhall not be preſſed to ſend in, or provide more or other ſorts or quantity of proviſions for the Horſe in any part of this County, then they are in truth able to performe, leaving to themſelves that proportion, which of neceſsity they muſt have for their own ſtock, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Husbandry. And laſtly, it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, that this County performing this with the King as aforeſaid, they ſhall not be urged, to ſend in or contribute towards any Proviſions for the maintenance of any other parts of His Majeſties Army, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered at <hi>Wallingford, Abingdon, Reading,</hi> or other places out of this County.</p>
